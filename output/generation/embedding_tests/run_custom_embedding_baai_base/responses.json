It also mentions that atrial repolarization occurs a mean of 320 ms after the end of the P wave, with a duration of 2-3 times that of the P wave, and always opposite in polarity to the P wave. This repolarization is signified on the ECG by a T wave. Furthermore, the context discusses the interpretation of different P wave morphologies, such as peaked P waves suggesting right atrial enlargement, and bifid P waves (P mitrale) indicating left atrial abnormality. If multiple different shaped P waves are seen in a tracing, it implies multiple ectopic foci. However, the context does not contain specific information on what exactly the P wave phase uniquely represents beyond these characteristics and interpretations.",
