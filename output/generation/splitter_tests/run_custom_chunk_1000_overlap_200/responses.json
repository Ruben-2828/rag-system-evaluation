It flows through several U.S. states including Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, and eventually flows into the Mississippi River. The river's source basin is in the western United States in Colorado, specifically the Arkansas River Valley, where headwaters derive from the snowpack in the Sawatch and Mosquito mountain ranges.

        "prediction": "The context contains information about the P wave representing atrial depolarization on an ECG. It details that the right atrium generally depolarizes slightly earlier than the left atrium. The process involves the depolarization wave originating in the sinoatrial node and traveling diagonally through the atria. Different morphologies of the P wave can indicate various conditions such as left atrial abnormality, ectopic foci, atrial fibrillation, sinus arrest, and atrial flutter. Absent P waves with a flat baseline may indicate fine atrial fibrillation or sinoatrial arrest with a secondary escape rhythm. The context also mentions that multiple different shaped P waves in a given ECG lead tracing suggests at least two separate ectopic foci and a possible multifocal atrial rhythm, common in chronic obstructive lung disease exacerbations.",
