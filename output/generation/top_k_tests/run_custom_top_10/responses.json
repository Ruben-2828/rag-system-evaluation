Absence of a P wave with a flat baseline may indicate fine atrial fibrillation or sinoatrial arrest with a secondary escape rhythm. Different morphologies of P waves may suggest various cardiac abnormalities, such as right atrial enlargement. The effective refractory period is related to pacemaker potential and conduction in electrocardiography.
