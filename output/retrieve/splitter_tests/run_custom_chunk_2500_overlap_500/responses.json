( February 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The P wave is a summation wave generated by the depolarization front as it transits the atria . Normally the right atrium depolarizes slightly earlier than left atrium since the depolarization wave originates in the sinoatrial node , in the high right atrium and then travels to and through the left atrium . The depolarization front is carried through the atria along semi-specialized conduction pathways including Bachmann 's bundle resulting in uniform shaped waves . Depolarization originating elsewhere in the atria ( atrial ectopics ) result in P waves with a different morphology from normal . Pathology ( edit ) Characteristic peaked P wave of cor pulmonale Peaked P waves ( > 0.25 mV ) suggest right atrial enlargement , cor pulmonale , ( P pulmonale rhythm ) , but have a low predictive value ( ~ 20 % ) . AP wave with increased amplitude can indicate hypokalemia . It can also indicate right atrial enlargement . AP wave with decreased amplitude can indicate hyperkalemia . Bifid P waves ( known as P mitrale ) indicate left - atrial abnormality - e.g. dilatation or hypertrophy . If at least three different shaped P waves can be seen in a given ECG lead tracing , this implies that even if one of them arises from the SA node , at least two others are arising elsewhere .

This appears particularly commonly in exacerbations of chronic obstructive lung disease .

        "prediction": "( 1986 ) caused the studio to plan for a new Star Trek television series , as it had thought to do in 1977 with Star Trek : Phase II before making the films . Paramount executives worried that a new show could hurt the demand for the films , but decided that it would increase their appeal on videocassette and cable , and that a show with unknown actors would be more profitable than paying the films ' actors ' large salaries . Roddenberry initially declined to be involved , but came on board as creator after being unhappy with early conceptual work . Star Trek : The Next Generation was announced on October 10 , 1986 , and its cast in May 1987 . Paramount executive Rick Berman was assigned to the show at Roddenberry 's request . Roddenberry hired a number of Star Trek veterans , including Bob Justman , D.C. Fontana , Eddie Milkis , and David Gerrold . Early proposals for the series included one in which some of the original series cast might appear as `` elder statesmen '' , and Roddenberry speculated as late as October 1986 that the new series might not even use a spaceship , as `` people might travel by some ( other ) means '' 100 years after the USS Enterprise ( NCC - 1701 ) . A more lasting change was his new belief that workplace interpersonal conflict would no longer exist in the future ; thus , the new series did not have parallels to the frequent `` crusty banter '' between Kirk , Spock , and Leonard McCoy . According to series actor Patrick Stewart , Berman was more receptive than Roddenberry to the show addressing political issues . The series ' music theme combined the fanfare from the original series theme by Alexander Courage with Jerry Goldsmith 's theme for Star Trek : The Motion Picture ( 1979 ) . Some early episodes ' plots derived from outlines created for Star Trek : Phase II . Additionally , some sets used in the Original Series - era films were redressed for The Next Generation , and in turn used for subsequent Original Series films . Part of the transporter room set in TNG was used in the original Star Trek 's transporter set . Many production details , such as LCARS computer interfaces and starship design , were carried through in the production of subsequent spin - offs . A major focus of the show is the faster - than - light starship visiting exoplanets , which , although some had speculated to exist , were still in the realm of science fiction when show started in the 1987 . However , by the early 1990s more claims were coming out",

( Elton John said the `` hook '' in his best - selling single `` Crocodile Rock '' was inspired by Ward 's `` Speedy Gonzales '' vocal . ) `` Wonderful Summer '' ( edit ) In 1963 , songwriter - producer Perry Botkin Jr. hired Jackie Ward to make a demo recording of `` Wonderful Summer '' , a song he wrote with co-writer and co-producer Gil Garfield . The purpose of a demo is to persuade `` name '' singers to record a song by demonstrating how it might be done . After recording Ward 's vocal at Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles , Botkin thought it might sound better if her voice was higher - pitched , so he sped up the recording by wrapping splicing tape around the capstan of the machine . Botkin realized the finished recording , with bird and surf sound effects added , was good enough to release as a pop music single . But because the sped - up singing sounded younger than 21 - year - old Jackie Ward , she suggested using her daughter 's first name Robin on the record label . That fall , `` Wonderful Summer '' was released by Dot Records as a 45rpm single . Sales exceeded one million copies in the United States , propelling the record to # 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart of December 14 -- 21 , 1963 . An album followed , with limited success . Jackie Ward made additional `` Robin Ward '' recordings , including a duet with radio DJ Wink Martindale , another Dot Records artist . In 1964 Ward released the single `` Winter 's Here '' , which reached # 123 on the Billboard chart . Because `` Wonderful Summer '' is her only Hot 100 hit , the singer named Robin Ward is considered a one - hit - wonder . However , while the public did not know Jackie 's real name , many of her other recordings were and still are widely heard . Post `` Robin Ward '' TV , movies , and records singing ( edit ) As her young - sounding Robin Ward records were disappearing from radio play , Jackie Ward 's grown - up singing career was expanding . At times in 1960s - 1970s she could be heard almost everywhere . In the early to mid-1960s Jackie was one of the singers on The Red Skelton Show and The Danny Kaye Show , and later , on The Carol Burnett Show . In the 1970s she sang on The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour . Ward sang in hundreds of commercials , most notably for Rice - a-Roni ( `` The San Francisco treat '' ) .

The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 92 % based on 386 reviews , with an average rating of 8.7 / 10 . The website 's critical consensus reads , `` There 's little that happens in On Golden Pond that is n't thoroughly predictable from the start , but the film is blessed with so much star power , charm and honest sentiment that everyone in the audience is willing to ignore the cliches and go the distance . '' Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun - Times said `` On Golden Pond was a treasure for many reasons , but the best one , I think , is that I could believe it . I could believe in its major characters and their relationships , and in the things they felt for one another , and there were moments when the movie was witness to human growth and change . I left the theater feeling good and warm , and with a certain resolve to try to mend my own relationships and learn to start listening better ... watching the movie , I felt I was witnessing something rare and valuable . '' Katharine Hepburn received the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Ethel Thayer , marking her fourth win in the category , making her the most awarded thespian in the history of the Academy Awards In his The New York Times review , Vincent Canby said , `` As a successful Broadway play , On Golden Pond was processed American cheese , smooth , infinitely spreadable and bland , with color added by the actors ... the movie ... still American cheese , but its stars -- Henry Fonda , Katharine Hepburn , Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman -- add more than color to this pasteurized product . On Golden Pond now has the bite of a good old cheddar ... Mr. Fonda gives one of the great performances of his long , truly distinguished career . Here is film acting of the highest order ... Miss Hepburn ... is also in fine form . One of the most appealing things about her as an actress is the way she responds to -- and is invigorated by -- a strong co-star ... she needs someone to support , challenge and interact with .
