It is represented on the surface ECG by a so - called Ta wave . The clinical relevance of this is that , although a normal phenomenon , the nadir of the Ta wave can occur just after the QRS complex and cause ST depression similar to ( and easily mistaken with ) that occurring with disease states such as cardiac ischaemia .
